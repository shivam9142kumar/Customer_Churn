# Data-Analysis---Telecom-Customer-Churn
**Introduction to Customer Churn :-**

Customer churn refers to the situation where customers terminate their relationship with a company or service provider. This often involves canceling subscriptions or contracts and either switching to a competitor or discontinuing the service. Managing customer churn is critical for businesses because high churn rates can negatively impact revenue and growth.

**Summary :-**

This project employs Python's pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy libraries to perform a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer churn. The dataset, sourced from a telecom company, was first cleaned by eliminating unnecessary columns and managing missing data.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase revealed significant insights into customer churn trends across various demographics and services. Visual tools such as pie charts and bar plots illustrated churn rates by gender and senior citizen status. Further analysis by contract type and payment method identified crucial factors affecting churn. Correlation matrices and other statistical summaries provided a deeper understanding of relationships between numerical features.

The project culminated in the creation of visualizations like histograms and box plots, which compared monthly charges and other metrics between churned and non-churned customers. These findings are intended to guide strategies aimed at enhancing customer retention and minimizing churn in the telecom sector.
